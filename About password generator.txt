This project isn't very hard and I'm 
sure about the fact that there's plethora of
password generators on github already, but I wanted to complete this task nonetheless.
The gui itself was written using tkinter, I wanted to simplify it as much as possible, therefore 
you can find only two buttons there - one that generates strong password with 5 uppercase letters, 5 lowercase, and 5 numbers.
The other button generates so called weak password, that has 3 uppercase letters, 3 lowercase, and 3 numbers.
Simple as that.
